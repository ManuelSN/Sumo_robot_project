<span>This is a project for the University's Microbotics course. It consists of the programming and customisation of a robot, in order to fight against others and expel them from the round tatami.<span>

<span>This has been programmed in C  and has been implemented in Tiva launchpad C Series, specifically in **TM4C123GH6PM** model. It implements FreeRTOS to manage different tasks.<span>

<span>The robot has different sensors, 4 line followers (2 at the front and 2 at the back). A SHARP infrared distance sensor and an endstop switch at the rear in order to detect if the enemy is approaching from there.<span>

<span>Also, it has a ramp at the front to eliminate enemies.<span><br><br><br><br><br>
